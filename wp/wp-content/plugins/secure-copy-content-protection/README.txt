== Block content with a password: (Content Locking) ==

This field is designed to protect parts of your content. Restrict content with a password by using a simple shortcode. You can create multiple shortcodes and write a password for each. Then you just need to copy the shortcode, go to posts/pages and edit already created post or add a new one. Put your content between the parts of the shortcode, in the place where is written "Content" ([ays_block id='1'] Content [/ays_block]).

* Shortcode - a new shortcode is created automatically after pressing "Add new" button.

* Password - write the password that a user has to fill in to be able to see the content. The number in the orange square shows the number of users who entered the password to see the content.

* Only for - choose a user role and enable a certain user to see the content without entering the password. The number in the orange square shows the number of times the content was viewed by a user role. 

* Schedule - there is a possibility to show the restricted content for a certain period of time and after that it will be disappeared from the page. 


== Subscribe to view: (Gated Content) ==

This field enables you to **hide the content** of any part of your post and show only when the user writes his/her email address.
Each time when the new user arrives at your website, and scrolls down and comes across the hidden content,
it will require the email address to continue reading.
Do you want to know your website visitors? This feature will perfectly fulfill your need. It is an amazing tool for gathering leads.
It will allow you to implement a customer-centric strategy on your website by segmenting and remarketing your leads.
